  Creates C3 architecture documentation from scratch using staged Socratic discovery.
  Use when the user asks to "adopt C3", "onboard me to architecture", "scaffold C3 docs",
  "init C3", "set up architecture docs", or starts C3 documentation for a new project.
  Implements 3-stage workflow: Inventory → Details → Finalize.

# C3 Onboarding

Initialize C3 architecture documentation using a **3-stage workflow with gates**.

## REQUIRED: Load References

**Load immediately:**
1. `../../references/skill-harness.md` - Red flags and complexity rules
2. `../../references/layer-navigation.md` - How to traverse C3 docs

**Load for templating:**
- `../../templates/adr-000.md` - Adoption ADR (drives the workflow)
- `../../templates/context.md` - Context template
- `../../templates/container.md` - Container template
- `../../templates/component.md` - Component template
- `../../templates/ref.md` - Reference template

    G2 -->|Inventory| S0_DISCOVER

**Critical:** All questioning MUST use `AskUserQuestion` tool - never plain text questions.

```

---

## Stage 0: Inventory

**Goal:** Discover EVERYTHING before creating any docs.

### 0.1 Create ADR-000

Run init script and create ADR-000 from template:
```bash
PROJECT="<name>" C1="<container1>" C2="<container2>" "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/c3-init.sh"
```

### 0.2 Context Discovery

Read codebase structure. Capture template arguments in **ADR-000 Context Discovery table**:

| Arg | Value |
|-----|-------|
| PROJECT | What is this system called? |
| GOAL | Why does this system exist? |
| SUMMARY | One-sentence description |

Use `AskUserQuestion` for gaps:
```
Q: "I see apps/api/ and apps/web/. Are these separate containers?"
Options: [Separate containers, Single monolith, Monorepo with shared code]
```

### 0.3 Container Discovery

For each potential container, capture in **ADR-000 Container Discovery table**:

| N | CONTAINER_NAME | GOAL | SUMMARY |
|---|----------------|------|---------|

Note: `N` maps to init script variable (C1=1, C2=2, etc.)

Use `AskUserQuestion`:
```
Q: "Is apps/api/ a deployable backend API?"
Options: [Yes - Backend API, No - Library/shared code, Need more context]
```

### 0.4 Component Discovery (Brief)

For each container, scan for components. Capture in **ADR-000 Component Discovery table**:

| N | NN | COMPONENT_NAME | CATEGORY | GOAL | SUMMARY |
|---|----|--------------  |----------|------|---------|

**Categorization (use lowercase in table):**
- **foundation** (01-09): Primitives others depend on (Router, AuthProvider, Database)
- **feature** (10+): Domain-specific (UserService, CheckoutFlow, Dashboard)

Use `AskUserQuestion`:
```
Q: "AuthMiddleware is imported by 15 files. Foundation or Feature?"
Options: [Foundation - others depend on it, Feature - domain logic, Need more context]
```

### 0.5 Ref Discovery

Look for patterns that repeat across components. Capture in **ADR-000 Ref Discovery table**:

| SLUG | TITLE | GOAL | Applies To |
|------|-------|------|------------|

Common ref candidates:
- Error handling patterns
- Form patterns
- Query/data fetching patterns
- Design system principles
- User flows / IA

### 0.6 Overview Diagram

Generate mermaid diagram showing:
- Actors → Containers → External Systems
- Key linkages

### Gate 0

Before proceeding, verify:
- [ ] Context args filled (PROJECT, GOAL, SUMMARY)
- [ ] All containers identified with args
- [ ] All components identified (brief) with args
- [ ] Cross-cutting refs identified
- [ ] Overview diagram generated

**If gaps:** Return to discovery with Socratic questioning.

---

## Stage 1: Details

**Goal:** Create all docs from inventory.

### 1.1 Context Doc

Create `.c3/README.md` from `context.md` template using discovered args.

Fill:
- Goal section (from PROJECT, GOAL)
- Overview diagram
- Containers table with Goal Contribution column

### 1.2 Container Docs

For EACH container in inventory:

**1.2.1 Create container README**

Create `.c3/c3-N-{slug}/README.md` from `container.md` template.

Fill:
- Goal section
- Context Connection (how it serves parent)
- Components table with Goal Contribution column

**1.2.2 Create component docs**

For each component in this container:

Create `.c3/c3-N-{slug}/c3-NNN-{component}.md` from `component.md` template.

Fill:
- Goal section
- Container Connection
- Related Refs table

**1.2.3 Handle discoveries**

If new component found during documentation:
- Add to ADR-000 Component Discovery table
- Document conflict in Conflict Resolution table
- Continue (will verify at Gate 2)

### 1.3 Ref Docs

For each ref in inventory:

Create `.c3/refs/ref-{slug}.md` from `ref.md` template.

Fill:
- Goal section
- Content sections
- Update Cited By as you create component docs

### Gate 1

Before proceeding, verify:
- [ ] All container README.md created
- [ ] All component docs created
- [ ] All refs documented
- [ ] No new items discovered (else → update ADR-000 inventory)

**If new items discovered:** Return to Stage 0, update ADR-000 discovery tables.

---

## Stage 2: Finalize

**Goal:** Verify integrity across all docs.

### 2.1 Integrity Checks

| Check | How to Verify |
|-------|---------------|
| Context ↔ Container | Every container in ADR-000 appears in c3-0 Containers table |
| Container ↔ Component | Every component in container README has a doc |
| Component ↔ Component | Linkages documented in Container README |
| * ↔ Refs | Refs Cited By section matches component Related Refs |

### 2.2 Run Audit

```
/c3 audit
```

### Gate 2

Before marking complete, verify:
- [ ] All integrity checks pass
- [ ] `/c3 audit` passes

**If issues:**
- Inventory issues (missing container/component) → Gate 0
- Detail issues (wrong Goal, missing connection) → Gate 1
- Pass → Mark ADR-000 as `implemented`

---

## Tiered Assumption Rules

| Impact | Examples | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| High | New External, boundary change, component reassignment | Ask first via AskUserQuestion |
| Low | Linkage reasoning, naming fix, add to inventory | Auto-proceed, note in Conflict Resolution |

---

## End-to-End Example

```
User: "Set up C3 for my project"

=== Stage 0: Inventory ===

[0.1] Run c3-init.sh, create ADR-000

Fill ADR-000 Context Discovery:
| PROJECT | Acme Platform |
| GOAL | E-commerce platform for small businesses |
| SUMMARY | Full-stack e-commerce with API and web frontend |

[0.3] Container Discovery
AskUserQuestion: "Are apps/api/ and apps/web/ separate containers?"

Found: auth/, products/, orders/, middleware/

AskUserQuestion: "AuthMiddleware - Foundation or Feature?"
User: "Foundation"

Fill ADR-000 Component Discovery:

| 1 | 10 | ProductService | feature | Product CRUD | Catalog management |
...

[0.5] Ref Discovery
Pattern found: error handling in 5 components

Fill ADR-000 Ref Discovery:
| error-handling | Error Handling | Consistent errors | c3-101, c3-110 |

[Gate 0] ✓ All tables filled, proceed to Stage 1

=== Stage 1: Details ===

[1.1] Create .c3/README.md from context.md template
[1.2] Create .c3/c3-1-api/README.md + component docs
[1.2] Create .c3/c3-2-web/README.md + component docs
[1.3] Create .c3/refs/ref-error-handling.md

[Gate 1] ✓ All docs created, no new items

=== Stage 2: Finalize ===

[2.1] Integrity checks - all pass
[2.2] /c3 audit - passes

[Gate 2] ✓ Mark ADR-000 as implemented

Done!
```
